# Skeleton for a SvelteKit + ASP.NET Core app

This is just the basic pieces put together to have a combination of a Svelte frontend and a .NET backend.

Clone and run by simply 'dotnet watch --project SvelteApp.Server\SvelteApp.Server.csproj', or open in Visual Studio (Code) and run using F5.

No thought has been put into how things look, whatsoever.

## What is set up

1. Standard SvelteKit javascript project.
2. A weather service using ASP.NET Core minimal APIs.
3. A SignalR hub for chat in .NET and a client in javascript.
4. A 3D view using Threlte and Three.js.
